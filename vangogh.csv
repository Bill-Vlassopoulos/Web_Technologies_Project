s0005V1962,The Potato Eaters,"https://iiif.micr.io/yzksg/full/900,/0/default.webp",Vincent van Gogh,82 cm x 114 cm,April-May 1885,oil on canvas,"Van Gogh saw the Potato Eaters as a showpiece, for which he deliberately chose a difficult composition to prove he was on his way to becoming a good figure painter. The painting had to depict the harsh reality of country life, so he gave the peasants coarse faces and bony, working hands. He wanted to show in this way that they ‘have tilled the earth themselves with these hands they are putting in the dish ... that they have thus honestly earned their food’.  He painted the five figures in earth colours – ‘something like the colour of a really dusty potato, unpeeled of course’. The message of the painting was more important to Van Gogh than correct anatomy or technical perfection. He was very pleased with the result: yet his painting drew considerable criticism because its colours were so dark and the figures full of mistakes. Nowadays, the Potato Eaters is one of Van Gogh’s most famous works."
s0019V1962,Garden with Courting Couples: Square Saint-Pierre,"https://iiif.micr.io/wTQHw/full/900,/0/default.webp",Vincent van Gogh,75.0 cm x 113.0 cm,May 1887,oil on canvas,"Van Gogh called this sunny park scene 'the painting of the garden with lovers'. Couples in love are strolling under the young chestnut trees and sitting along the winding paths.He used a free variation on the technique of the Pointillists. They built up their compositions from dots of paint. Van Gogh instead applied small brushstrokes of varying length in different directions. This helped him to create the effect of a radiant spring day, which fit the sense of intimacy and togetherness he wished to express. He too longed for a wife and a family, but he had 'the most impossible love affairs'. He eventually resigned himself to the situation; he was devoted to his art."
s0022V1962,Self-Portrait as a Painter,"https://iiif.micr.io/qDCTO/full/900,/0/default.webp",Vincent van Gogh,65.1 cm x 50 cm,December 1887-February 1888,oil on canvas,"Van Gogh presented himself in this self-portrait as a painter, holding a palette and paintbrushes behind his easel. He showed that he was a modern artist by using a new painting style, with bright, almost unblended colours. The palette contains the complementary colour pairs red/green, yellow/purple and blue/orange – precisely the colours Van Gogh used for this painting. He laid these pairs down side by side to intensify one another: the blue of his smock, for instance, and the orange-red of his beard.Self-Portrait as a Painter was the last work Van Gogh produced in Paris; the city had exhausted him both mentally and physically. He told his sister Wil how he had portrayed himself: ‘wrinkles in forehead and around the mouth, stiffly wooden, a very red beard, quite unkempt and sad’."

All in all, he made more than 30 drawings and paintings on this theme. He painted this sower in the autumn of 1888. At the time, Van Gogh was working together with Paul Gauguin (1848-1903). Gauguin believed that in his work Van Gogh should draw less on reality and more on his imagination.Here, Van Gogh used colours meant to express emotion and passion. He assigned the leading roles to the greenish-yellow of the sky and the purple of the field. The bright yellow sun looks like a halo, turning the sower into a saint."

The green shutters in this painting of the square show where he lived. Shortly after moving into the ‘Yellow House’, he sent Theo a description and sketch of his painting of it: ‘it’s tremendous, these yellow houses in the sunlight and then the incomparable freshness of the blue.’The work, which Van Gogh himself called ‘The Street’, records the artist’s immediate surroundings: he often ate at the restaurant on the left, and the home of his friend, the postman Joseph Roulin, lay just beyond the second railway bridge.Vincent had finally found a place at the Yellow House where he could not only paint but also have his friends come to stay. His plan was to turn the yellow corner-building into an artists’ house, where like-minded painters could live and work together."
s0047V1962,The Bedroom,"https://iiif.micr.io/ZKSPH/full/900,/0/default.webp",Vincent van Gogh,72.4 cm x 91.3 cm,October 1888,oil on canvas,This painting is on view in the exhibition Matthew Wong | Vincent van Gogh until 1 September 2024.
s0049V1962,Wheatfield with a Reaper,"https://iiif.micr.io/HDzja/full/900,/0/default.webp",Vincent van Gogh,73.2 cm x 92.7 cm,September 1889,oil on canvas,"Van Gogh painted this walled field from his hospital room. For the first few months that he was there, he was not allowed to leave the grounds.The reaper labours in the heat of the sun. The wheat, painted with thick gobs of yellow, undulates around him. For Van Gogh, wheat was a symbol of the eternal cycle of nature and the transience of life. He saw the reaper as 'the image of death . . . in this sense that humanity would be the wheat being reaped.'He added, however, that this death was 'almost smiling. It's all yellow except for a line of violet hills – a pale, blond yellow. I myself find that funny, that I saw it like that through the iron bars of a cell.'"
s0050V1962,Irises,"https://iiif.micr.io/HVTVF/full/900,/0/default.webp",Vincent van Gogh,92.7 cm x 73.9 cm,May 1890,oil on canvas,"Van Gogh painted this still life in the psychiatric hospital in Saint-Rémy. For him, the painting was mainly a study in colour. He set out to achieve a powerful colour contrast. By placing the purple flowers against a yellow background, he made the decorative forms stand out even more strongly. The irises were originally purple. But as the red pigment has faded, they have turned blue. Van Gogh made two paintings of this bouquet. In the other still life, he contrasted purple and pink with green."
s0106V1962,Wheatfield under Thunderclouds,"https://iiif.micr.io/fhXoU/full/900,/0/default.webp",Vincent van Gogh,50.4 cm x 101.3 cm,July 1890,oil on canvas,"In the last weeks of his life, Van Gogh completed a number of impressive paintings of the wheatfields around Auvers. This outspread field under a dark sky is one of them.In these landscapes he tried to express 'sadness, extreme loneliness'. But the overwhelming emotions that Van Gogh experienced in nature were also positive. He wrote to his brother Theo, 'I'd almost believe that these canvases will tell you what I can't say in words, what I consider healthy and fortifying about the countryside.'The elongated format of Wheatfields under Thunderclouds is unusual. It emphasizes the grandeur of the landscape, as does the simple composition: two horizontal planes."
s0149V1962,Wheatfield with Crows,"https://iiif.micr.io/QHzII/full/900,/0/default.webp",Vincent van Gogh,50.5 cm x 103 cm,July 1890,oil on canvas,"Wheatfield with Crows is one of Van Gogh's most famous paintings. It is often claimed that this was his very last work. The menacing sky, the crows and the dead-end path are said to refer to the end of his life approaching. But that is just a persistent myth. In fact, he made several other works after this one.Van Gogh did want his wheatfields under stormy skies to express 'sadness, extreme loneliness', but at the same time he wanted to show what he considered 'healthy and fortifying about the countryside'.Van Gogh used powerful colour combinations in this painting: the blue sky contrasts with the yellow-orange wheat, while the red of the path is intensified by the green bands of grass."
s0176V1962,Almond Blossom,"https://iiif.micr.io/rAERt/full/900,/0/default.webp",Vincent van Gogh,73.3 cm x 92.4 cm,February 1890,oil on canvas,"Large blossom branches like this against a blue sky were one of Van Gogh’s favourite subjects. Almond trees flower early in the spring making them a symbol of new life. Van Gogh borrowed the subject, the bold outlines and the positioning of the tree in the picture plane from Japanese printmaking.The painting was a gift for his brother Theo and sister-in-law Jo, who had just had a baby son, Vincent Willem. In the letter announcing the new arrival, Theo wrote: ‘As we told you, we’ll name him after you, and I’m making the wish that he may be as determined and as courageous as you.’ Unsurprisingly, it was this work that remained closest to the hearts of the Van Gogh family. Vincent Willem went on to found the Van Gogh Museum."
s0195V1962,Tree Roots,"https://iiif.micr.io/giZUM/full/900,/0/default.webp",Vincent van Gogh,50.3 cm x 100.1 cm,July 1890,oil on canvas,"This painting seems at first sight to consist of a jumble of bright colours and fanciful abstract forms. Only after that do you realise that it shows a slope with tree trunks and roots. These are trees used for timber, growing in a marl quarry. Such quarries could be found around Auvers (FR). The work was not entirely completed. That explains its unfinished appearance. It is probably Van Gogh's very last painting. Andries Bonger, the brother-in-law of Vincent's brother Theo, described it in a letter: 'The morning before his death, he had painted a sous-bois [forest scene], full of sun and life.'"
s0206V1962,Self-Portrait with Portrait of Gauguin,"https://iiif.micr.io/iXnxI/full/900,/0/default.webp",Emile Bernard,46 cm x 56 cm,1888,oil on canvas,"Bernard painted this self-portrait in the French seaside village of Pont-Aven. He was working there with Paul Gauguin (shown in the background of the picture). A Japanese woodcut print is visible at bottom right.Van Gogh had asked his two friends to make portraits of each other. But Bernard didn’t dare: he was only 20 and intimidated by Gauguin, who was twice his age. So each of them sent a self-portrait featuring a sketch of the other. Beside his signature, Bernard wrote a dedication to his friend (‘copain’) Van Gogh. The added ‘g’ at the end of ‘copain’ was a joke about the local accent in Provence, where Van Gogh was living."
s0224V1962,Self-Portrait with Portrait of Emile Bernard (Les misérables),"https://iiif.micr.io/LJtwZ/full/900,/0/default.webp",Paul Gauguin,44.5 cm x 50.3 cm,1888,oil on canvas,"Van Gogh knew that Japanese printmakers often exchanged work with one another. The idea appealed to him, so he suggested that he, Paul Gauguin and Emile Bernard should do the same: ‘It clearly proves that they liked one another and stuck together, and that there was a certain harmony among them [. . .] The more we resemble them in that respect, the better it will be for us.’ His friends both sent self-portraits, with a likeness of the other artist in the background.Gauguin painted himself in the guise of Jean Valjean, the main character of Victor Hugo’s novel Les Misérables, equating the vibrant and loving fictional outcast with the misunderstood artists of his time. He wrote: ‘By doing him with my features, you have my individual image, as well as a portrait of us all, poor victims of society, taking our revenge on it by doing good’. The cheerful floral pattern on the wall was Gauguin’s way of testifying to ‘our artistic virginity’.Van Gogh was impressed by the portrait’s melancholy character. He described the shadows in Gauguin’s face as ‘lugubriously tinged with blue’ and noted that he looked ill and tormented.’"
s0225V1962,Vincent van Gogh Painting Sunflowers,"https://iiif.micr.io/iWYqT/full/900,/0/default.webp",Paul Gauguin,73 cm x 91 cm,1888,oil on canvas,"Was Van Gogh really painting a vase of sunflowers when his friend Gauguin produced this portrait of him? No, he can’t have been: it was December and far too late in the year for sunflowers. But it’s quite probable that Van Gogh painted a copy of one of his own sunflower pictures around this time. The landscape in the background is also fictional: unlike Van Gogh, Gauguin liked to work from his imagination. They often argued about this. This painting refers to their disagreement. Later, Van Gogh wrote about this portrait: ‘My face has lit up a lot since, but it was indeed me, extremely tired and charged with electricity as I was then.’"

She gazes provocatively through her eyelashes, her hand placed nonchalantly on her hip.Although this is a portrait of Van Dongen’s wife, it is her bright blue dress that steals the show. It contrasts strongly with Guus’s pale complexion and the red background, causing it to leap out of the canvas. Van Dongen painted the shadows on his wife’s arms and neck in bright green.Working with areas of solid colour and bold contrasts is a typical feature of this artist’s work. The painting was directly inspired by Van Gogh’s bright colours and expressive brushwork."
s0507S2002,The Jetty of Boulogne-sur-Mer,"https://iiif.micr.io/eRPvZ/full/900,/0/default.webp",Edouard Manet,59.5 cm x 73.3 cm,1868,oil on canvas,No description available
s0508S2003,View Seen Through a Balcony,"https://iiif.micr.io/cFuKP/full/900,/0/default.webp",Gustave Caillebotte,65.6 cm x 54.9 cm,1880,oil on canvas,"The French artist Gustave Caillebotte painted the view from his Paris balcony in 1880. The real subject of the painting, though, is the balcony itself, the cast-iron curls of which form a decorative pattern that fills the picture plane. In the distance we make out Boulevard Hausmann with a carriage, an advertising column and passers-by.Caillebotte used dark colours to emphasize the centrality of the railing. It stands out sharply against the street scene, which he painted in pastel tones. The bold composition was inspired by Japanese prints, the abrupt cropping, high vantage points and solid colours of which made them an important source for artists looking for a modern style.Van Gogh was intrigued by Caillebotte’s work. The announcement of an exhibition prompted him to write to his brother Theo: ‘there’ll be some works by Caillebotte – I’ve never seen anything of his, and wanted to ask you to write and tell me what they’re like.’"
s0515S2008,Montmartre in the Rain,"https://iiif.micr.io/AIlXy/full/900,/0/default.webp",Pierre Bonnard,69.9 cm x 95.0 cm,1897,oil on paper on panel,"When he painted this townscape, Bonnard took on a double challenge: the light was failing and it was raining. He was looking out of the window of his Montmartre studio at a view he depicted in a number of works.His decision to place an expanse of blank wall at the centre of the composition is daring. It gives the least picturesque part of the painting the most emphasis. But there is more to it: look at the perspective. Bonnard has used the difference in distance to the middle roofs and the street in an illogical way. He borrowed ideas for this kind of division of the picture plane and irregular perspective from Japanese prints."

The picture shows Christ sitting at table and breaking bread. Facing him is Denis himself. He is the disciple who has just realised the identity of his extraordinary table companion. Denis’ wife Marthe is entering the room carrying a dish.Denis presents the Bible story in a modern setting: the inn in his own home town. Notice the contemporary rug on the floor , for example. But the composition, with its glimpses of the outside world, is inspired by early Italian frescoes. Denis also made a print based on this painting."
s0530N2012,Tulip Fields near The Hague,"https://iiif.micr.io/WONpp/full/900,/0/default.webp",Claude Monet,66 cm x 81.5 cm,1886,oil on canvas,"Claude Monet was enormously impressed by the brightly coloured bulb fields of Holland. In the early spring of 1886, he wrote to a friend that the sight was ‘impossible to convey with our poor colours’. Monet had been to the Netherlands before, but was painting the sea of flowers for the first time.Back in Paris, he sold the painting via art dealers Boussod, Valadon & Cie, where Theo van Gogh worked. It’s quite possible that his brother Vincent saw it there. Vincent gradually came to admire Monet’s swift brushstrokes and bright colours."
d0171V1962,Peasant Woman Digging,"https://iiif.micr.io/CDSdE/full/900,/0/default.webp",Vincent van Gogh,55.7 cm x 41.0 cm,July-September 1885,chalk on paper,"Van Gogh struggled for a long time to represent figures convincingly: they tended to look too flat. He realised in 1885 that he needed to build them up from large round forms rather than contours. This burly peasant woman is a successful example. The proportions may not be accurate, but this was deliberate: Van Gogh wanted to make the drawing more expressive.In a letter to his brother Theo, Vincent described his drawings of farm workers as 'the start of a whole series about all kinds of work in the fields'. He hoped that scenes of this kind would establish his reputation as an artist of peasant life."

The window looks out over the walled garden. Pots and bottles stand on the windowsill. Several of Van Gogh's own paintings hang on either side of the window.Van Gogh began by setting out his design in black chalk. Then he developed the drawing further using thinned oil paint and a little watercolour. Between the bars and the blue of the sky he left the paper visible, which adds depth to the scene."
d0340V1962,Tree with Ivy in the Garden of the Asylum,"https://iiif.micr.io/aXpfg/full/900,/0/default.webp",Vincent van Gogh,61.8 cm x 47.1 cm,May-June 1889,pencil,"In May 1889, Van Gogh had himself admitted to the psychiatric hospital in Saint-Rémy because of his fragile mental health. At first he was not allowed to leave the walled grounds of the institution. Fortunately, the overgrown garden offered him plenty of inspiration. This drawing is a realistic representation of that garden."

They feature prominently in many of his paintings and drawings, including this one. In a letter to his brother Theo, he compared a row of pollard trees to a 'procession of orphan men'. What he meant was that nature had a soul of its own.This work is part of a series of seven pen and ink drawings of Brabant landscapes from 1884. The compositions are compelling. The way he drew it, with a great deal of hatching, shows his individual style. The drawings form a high point of Van Gogh's work in the Netherlands."
d0378V1962,Worn Out,"https://iiif.micr.io/oWRVN/full/900,/0/default.webp",Vincent van Gogh,50.4 cm x 31.6 cm,November 1882,pencil on paper,"'What a fine sight an old working man makes, in his patched bombazine suit with his bald head,' Van Gogh wrote about this drawing. The artist had a penchant for working-class figures, marked by life, and the title Worn Out emphasizes the dramatic element of his chosen theme.This tired, bent old man lived at the Dutch Reformed Almshouse for Men and Women in The Hague. Residents of the home posed for Van Gogh in old, worn-out clothing in return for a small payment.Van Gogh made dozens of large figure drawings in The Hague, in which he practised representing human proportions, poses and facial expressions."
d0386M1977,Landscape with a Stack of Peat and Farmhouses,"https://iiif.micr.io/kytiQ/full/900,/0/default.webp",Vincent van Gogh,41.7 cm x 54.1 cm,September-December 1883,watercolour on paper,"The dark structure in the middle of the drawing looks like a cottage, but it is actually a stack of peat. In Drenthe, peat was stacked in the form of a house with a sloping roof. Van Gogh gave the stack of peat a central place in his composition and showed its reflection in the ditch.He wrote to his brother Theo that at dusk the fields of Drenthe were transformed into a 'sublime' place, 'when that vast, sun-scorched earth stands out dark against the delicate lilac tints of the evening sky, and the very last fine dark blue line on the horizon separates earth from sky'."
d0420V1962,Gate in the Paris Ramparts,"https://iiif.micr.io/TznmE/full/900,/0/default.webp",Vincent van Gogh,24.1 cm x 31.6 cm,June-September 1887,pencil,"In the summer of 1887, Van Gogh made four watercolour drawings of the city walls around Paris. This is most likely the Porte de Clichy – one of 25 gates leading into the French capital.The lively cityscape is filled with little figures and details like the horse-drawn tram. Van Gogh drew inspiration for this drawing from the crowded street scenes in Japanese prints. The bright colours of those prints also stimulated his creativity.This cityscape is one of the few drawings he made in Paris. He mostly worked in oil paint on canvas during his time there and developed a brighter, more modern colour palette. Colour and brightness also play a central role in this watercolour drawing."
d0423V1962,Weaver,"https://iiif.micr.io/MoiLH/full/900,/0/default.webp",Vincent van Gogh,35.5 cm x 44.6 cm,December 1883-August 1884,pencil,"When Van Gogh lived in Nuenen he became fascinated by the weavers there, who worked in their homes. They were poverty-stricken and had to work very hard to earn a living. He made sixteen large drawings of them, including this one in watercolour and ink.The loom fills almost the entire picture. Van Gogh devoted considerable attention to representing the machine accurately. It was hard, 'because in the small rooms one can't get far enough away to draw the loom', he wrote.Vincent was confident about the qualities of his weaver drawings. He hoped to be able to sell them. That probably explains why he signed this drawing."

He completed only a few large, finished drawings, including this one of a vineyard in Auvers. We find the same wavy lines in his late paintings.Van Gogh began with a pencil drawing. Then he added oil paint and watercolour in many different shades of blue. He painted some of the roofs red, but these have since faded to brown. Because he left large areas of the paper blank, the colour white plays a large role in the scene."

In 1885, he made them the subject of five still lifes in a row. He wrote to his brother Theo that he thought these would appeal to nature lovers, 'because of the colours of the moss, dry leaves and grasses, clay &c.'.Earlier that summer, Vincent had told Theo how he got the nests. He had gone out with a peasant boy to look for them. They found six, 'from which the young had already flown, so that one could take them without too many pangs of conscience.'"

The tower had remained standing when the church collapsed a century earlier, but at the time of this painting it was being demolished. The steeple is already gone.In a letter to his brother Theo, Vincent explained what he wanted this painting to express. He saw the dilapidated church tower as a symbol of the ephemeral nature of religion. In his eyes, it formed a stark contrast with the country graveyard next to it. There, farmers lay buried in the same soil they once had tilled. This showed that their lives were rooted in the eternal truths of death and rebirth."

To prepare for that painting, Van Gogh made over 40 studies of farmworkers' heads, including this one. He hoped this would make him a better figure painter.Van Gogh wanted to portray peasants as people of a special kind, who had been working the land for centuries. 'They remind one of the earth, sometimes appear to have been modelled out of it,' Vincent wrote to his brother Theo.This work was a study in colour. Van Gogh concentrated on the complementary colours red and green."

Would he paint the scene by daylight or lamplight? He couldn’t decide, so he was experimenting with all sorts of interior light effects.In this picture, he was attempting to paint a figure against the light. It was hard to do, he wrote to his brother Theo, ‘it’s a difficult effect’. With the almost black head of the woman and using a lot of white in the window, he succeeded in achieving a strong contrast. He concentrated the light from the window mainly on the woman’s hands."

They then resemble silver coins, and in Dutch this plant is called the judaspenning, 'coin of Judas'. This is a reference to the apostle Judas, who betrayed Christ for 30 pieces of silver. He is said to have thrown the coins to the ground when he hanged himself. Where they landed, the honesty plant later grew. This is one of the first still lifes painted by Van Gogh."

An acquaintance of Van Gogh's in Paris described how he bought old work shoes at a flea market. Then he walked through the mud in them until they were filthy. Only then did he feel they were interesting enough to paint. Van Gogh made a number of still lifes of this subject.He painted Shoes over another picture: a view from his brother Theo's apartment. Van Gogh used the same canvas more than once on other occasions too. It was a way of saving money.

That was already true in Van Gogh's day. But the hill of Montmartre then had buildings only on one side. Here, Van Gogh painted the other side. You can see quarries and a view of the mills, which had already been absorbed into the built-up part of the district. In the foreground is a pile of wood; behind it are blocks of stone.Van Gogh was not the only artist to paint this picturesque place.

He created depth in the composition by making the roofs and chimneys in the foreground seem close by. Further away, the outlines of monumental buildings are visible in the city centre. Panthéon, Louvre, Notre Dame; all of them have been identified.Van Gogh made the buildings fairly large and detailed in proportion to the rest of the landscape. He probably used a telescope.

The unpaved street has stone gutters, represented by blue stripes. The mill on wheels in the centre was probably a movable billboard. There were several real mills on the hill of Montmartre in Paris, and one is visible in the background (the Moulin à Poivre).

It is clear from the work that he had studied the technique of the Pointillists and applied it in his own, original way. He placed the short stripes of paint in different directions. Where they follow the outline of his head, they form a kind of halo.The painting is also one of Van Gogh’s boldest colour experiments in Paris. He placed complementary colours alongside one another using long brushstrokes: blue and orange in the background, and red and green in the beard and eyes. The colours intensify one another. The red pigment has faded, so the purple strokes are now blue, which means the contrast with the yellow is less powerful."

She had a brief relationship with Van Gogh. There is a glass of beer on the table, and Agostina holds a lit cigarette. The saucers under the glass on the table betray the fact that she is on her second beer. Drinking and smoking in a café was not appropriate for respectable ladies. That way of life was associated with artistic types and prostitutes.Van Gogh had organized an exhibition at the café to sell his collection of Japanese prints. Japanese prints can be seen in the background of this portrait. He may have painted Agostina during the exhibition."

There are allotment gardens in the foreground.Van Gogh used a variety of brushwork here over a light ground, from light strokes to quick dashes and specks of paint. The influence of the Impressionists is clear from the bright colours and loose painting technique."

Van Gogh made the challenge even greater, choosing an elaborate carafe and decorative wallpaper. This made it necessary for him to render the colourful reflections in the glass.The tabletop underneath the dish of lemons is tilted upward. This is not a mistake, but a choice. Van Gogh was trying out a perspective technique he had learned from Japanese woodcuts. Their strong diagonals fascinated him. Vincent signed and dated this still life.

He showed with this still life that he was a genuine colourist, working almost exclusively with shades of yellow, as well as a little green, blue, red and pink. He used threads of wool to try out colour combinations before beginning to paint.Van Gogh also painted the frame of this work. It is the only original frame that has survived.

He enthusiastically painted a large series of studies of orchards in blossom. These plum trees were poorly maintained, as their long branches show.

There is an earlier, nearly identical version of this painting, which Van Gogh had completed in one sitting. ‘I’d worked on a no. 20 canvas in the open air in an orchard — ploughed lilac field, a reed fence — two pink peach trees against a glorious blue and white sky. Probably the best landscape I’ve done’, he wrote.When he returned home, he saw the death notice of Anton Mauve (1838-1888), his uncle by marriage. Mauve was a well-known painter from whom Van Gogh had once taken lessons. He dedicated that first work to Mauve and made this new version later to send to Theo."

After a few weeks, spring came. Full of enthusiasm, he began a series of studies of trees in blossom. When he saw the paintings side by side, he had the idea of combining them into triptychs. In a triptych, three works are combined into one harmonious whole. Van Gogh was familiar with this idea from Japanese prints.Van Gogh went on to produce no fewer than fourteen paintings of fruit trees in blossom in the space of a month. He hoped his orchard paintings would sell. To his brother Theo he wrote, 'You know these subjects are among the ones that cheer everyone up.'"

Compared to the irregular surface of the sandy beach, they've been painted in an overly two-dimensional way. The boats are made up of areas of uniform colour within strong outlines. Furthermore, the boats don't cast shadows on the beach. These stylistic elements were familiar to Van Gogh from his collection of Japanese prints.Van Gogh would have preferred to make this painting on the beach, but he couldn't, because the fishermen put out to sea very early every morning. He did draw the boats there, however, and later made this painting at home."

Van Gogh combined the azure blue of the sky with yellow and green tones for the land to capture the atmosphere of a summer’s day. He worked in the wheatfields for days at a time under the burning sun. This was an immensely productive period, in which he completed ten paintings and five drawings in just over a week, until a heavy storm brought the harvest season to an end.Van Gogh wanted to show peasant life and work on the land – a recurring theme in his art – and painted several stages of the harvest. We see a half mowed wheatfield, ladders and several carts. A reaper works in the background, which is why he titled the work La moisson or 'The Harvest'. Van Gogh considered it one of his most successful paintings, writing to his brother Theo that the ‘canvas absolutely kills all the rest’."

This work illustrates what he had learned in Paris. There he had encountered a variety of new art movements, including Impressionism and Pointillism.As soon as he arrived in the southern city of Arles, he began painting his surroundings. He tried to use everything he had learned to find a style of his own. For instance, he varied his brushwork from dots and specks to larger strokes.

But filling the whole length and breadth of the canvas with it gives it something majestic. Van Gogh learned this technique of isolating, enlarging and foregrounding a single element of a landscape from Japanese woodcuts. He admired Japanese prints enormously and constantly tried to equal them in his paintings. It was the height of spring. Van Gogh said that he had six paintings of ‘blossoming fruit trees’ on the go.

Van Gogh and his brother Theo had a joint collection of Japanese woodcuts. Vincent said that these made him happy and cheerful. He also took many ideas from them for his own art.Like many of his contemporaries, Van Gogh was inspired by the Japanese style of visual representation. Subjects were sometimes shown in close-up in the foreground or cut off abruptly at the edge of the picture. Van Gogh was also drawn to the attention paid in Japanese prints to details from nature. Flowering orchards were a frequent subject. Van Gogh still had these models in mind in 1888, when he painted a series of orchards in blossom."

He particularly loved the contrast between the yellow and purple flowers in the fields.In the landscape, he felt he could see a reflection of the world he knew from his collection of Japanese prints. Japanese artists used large areas of colour in their compositions, often with a sharp diagonal. They also regularly zoomed in on a detail in the foreground. Van Gogh adopted these elements in his paintings. It was just like 'a Japanese dream,' he wrote in a letter to his brother Theo.The painting was recently examined and restored. In the process, the old discoloured varnish layer which had dulled the colours was removed. The colours are now much brighter."

It was the first time since moving to France that he returned to a muted colour palette. In the Netherlands, he had always used sober colours. But since then, he had adopted the bright hues of the Impressionists. This painting turned out very differently from his Dutch works, however, because he used different pigments.While working on this painting, Van Gogh was not feeling well: he sensed an attack of his illness coming on.

He worked from black-and-white prints, copying the images fairly accurately but choosing the colours himself.He based this painting on a small wood engraving. It was part of Travaux des champs (‘Work in the Fields’), a ten-part series of prints based on paintings by Jean-François Millet (1814-1875).

In the autumn he made this painting, which he called a 'leaf-fall'. The seasonal atmosphere is suggested by the colours, the lone walker and the leaves blown by the wind.Van Gogh chose a high viewpoint for the painting, so the outlines of the trunks are cut off by the upper and lower edges. He had learned this compositional technique from Japanese prints and the work of his friends, the artists Émile Bernard and Paul Gauguin."

The modern novels and burning candle on the green seat cushion symbolize the character of the absent painter.Using mainly red and green hues, Van Gogh tried to suggest the mood of night. He also painted a pendant of this work with a daytime atmosphere: his own simple peasant chair in bright yellow and blue. The two paintings represent the different personalities of the two artists, who quarrelled and went their separate ways soon afterwards.Van Gogh skilfully captured the bluish shadows and reflected light on the polished wood of the chair.

So when he decided to practise painting plaster models of classical sculptures, he immediately produced a whole series. He painted this torso of Venus five times, in each case from a different angle.This time he has turned the model to face away from him. He has used a lot of paint and followed the curves of the body with his brush."

In June 1886, they moved into an apartment on Rue Lepic. Theo described its fine views of the city in a letter. He concluded, 'The different effects produced by atmospheric variations make it a subject for I don't know how many paintings.'Van Gogh adopted an unusual approach to this view. On part of the canvas, he used the stippling technique he had learned from the Pointillists. He painted other parts loosely and freely. He probably felt that laying down the little dots was too rigid and time-consuming. It was out of keeping with his spontaneous way of painting."

If you look carefully, you can just spot a white bonnet peeping out from under it. In the spring and summer of 1885, Van Gogh drew and painted other women wearing shawls over their heads in this way. They were worn at funerals or when in mourning."
s0059V1962,Head of a Woman,"https://iiif.micr.io/TBWyy/full/900,/0/default.webp",Vincent van Gogh,35.2 cm x 24.4 cm,December 1885,oil on canvas,"During his stay in Antwerp, Van Gogh searched for models to sit for portraits. He was hoping to profile himself as a modern painter of contemporary city life. He was particularly interested in working-class people, one of whom was the woman portrayed here. Perhaps she worked in a café and, like many impoverished women, was forced to earn extra money as a prostitute at night.While her face evinces the traces of hard work, Van Gogh also wanted to convey her beauty. In these ‘studies of heads’ the artist was not interested in depicting an individual likeness, but rather a type. He painted the woman's face and long, loose hair with broad brushstrokes, thereby successfully introducing volume and life into them. He probably depicted the same woman in another painting as well."

This woodland scene is a good example. He covered the entire canvas with small dots of paint. The result is a play of light and shadow on the ground between the trees. The strip of yellow in the middle suggests the sunlight of a clearing in the distance. Along with the tree trunk on the right, it brings depth to the scene.Van Gogh drew strength from nature: 'Sometimes it's precisely those spots where one no longer feels anything of what's known as the civilized world ... sometimes it's precisely those spots that one needs to achieve calm.'"

For the sake of the colour contrast, he painted red bricks on the right. Such bricks were not used in Arles.Van Gogh was pleased that he had the opportunity to draw and paint this infantryman.

He painted small studies that were easy to carry, like this one.In this small painting, Van Gogh experimented with the stippling technique of the Pointillists, but he did so in his own way.

Are those brambles in the foreground? With streaks of purplish blue for the ripe blackberries and dark red for the unripe fruit?But perhaps it’s worth thinking less about what Van Gogh was painting here than about how he painted it – using little dots and dashes to depict light and shade. He picked up this way of painting from the Neo-Impressionists. Their style is sometimes called Pointillism (or ‘dotted art’) and it was the very latest thing in Paris at that time. Paul Signac was one of their leading lights. Van Gogh got to know him after he moved to the French capital."

He painted The Bridge at Courbevoie in a single session, focusing on the reflections in the water. He was less concerned with using correct perspective or with the proportions of the human figures.Van Gogh used dashes of paint in all sorts of colours, side by side and sometimes layered. This was his own free variation on Pointillism. That method was familiar to him from the work of artists such as Georges Seurat (1859-1891) and Paul Signac (1863-1935).

Van Gogh called these humble farmhouses 'people's nests'. He felt they had a sheltering quality. This cottage contains two houses with two front doors and a shared chimney. That type of dwelling was then on the brink of disappearing. 'The thing struck me greatly; those two cottages, half decayed under one and the same thatched roof, reminded me of a couple of worn-out old folk who make up just one single being and whom one sees supporting each other,' he wrote.The subject continued to fascinate him. Four years later, in France, he returned to drawing and painting old houses. Over the years, however, his style of painting had changed significantly: by that time, he used bright colours and loose brushwork."

He 'zoomed in' on the plants with their waving leaves and heavy stalks. The green sea of wheat is interrupted by a blue cornflower in the upper left and the pink bindweed in the lower right.Van Gogh described this decorative painting to his friend, the artist Paul Gauguin, as follows: 'nothing more than ears of wheat, green-blue stalks, long, ribbon-like leaves, under a sheen of green and pink; ears of wheat, yellowing slightly, with an edge made pale pink by the dusty manner of flowering.' The colours were supposed to evoke 'the soft rustle of the ears of grain swaying back and forth in the wind.'"

This celebrated landscape painter had lived in Auvers. So when Vincent arrived in the village, he went to see Daubigny's home and garden as soon as he could. This is Van Gogh's first painting of the garden. He later made two larger ones on canvas.Because Van Gogh did not have any canvas at hand, he painted the garden on a red and white striped tea towel. He first covered the towel with a bright pink ground layer of lead-white pigment mixed with red. This pink base formed a vivid contrast with the green paint he used for the garden.

Van Gogh spent the last two months of his life there. Throughout the ten years that Van Gogh worked as an artist, he experimented with different ways of applying paint. This landscape shows a large variety of brushstrokes. For the plants in the foreground, he used rounded, flowing brushwork. For the string of coloured roofs in the middle, he used vertical stripes. The green fields beyond the village are areas of nearly uniform colour. The sky is unfinished. He outlined the clouds with a few swift streaks of blue."

He rendered the tangled black branches of the pear trees with a flurry of black brushstrokes. This reinforces the contrast between the dark trees and the luminous yellow sky.The painting seems somewhat like a panorama because of its wide format. It is one metre wide and 50 centimetres high.

This gave him a chance to explore the Japanese printmakers' style and use of colour.The first of these copies is based on Utagawa Hiroshige's Plum Garden in Kameido. Van Gogh accurately reproduced the composition but made the colours much more intense. He replaced the black and grey of Hiroshige's tree trunk with red and blue tones. He also added the two orange borders with Japanese characters for a decorative and exotic effect.
s0116V1962,Courtesan (after Eisen),"https://iiif.micr.io/DZtPS/full/900,/0/default.webp",Vincent van Gogh,100.7 cm x 60.7 cm,October-November 1887,oil on cotton,"Van Gogh based this painting on a woodcut by the Japanese artist Kesai Eisen. The print had been reproduced on the cover of the magazine Paris illustré in 1886. Van Gogh used a grid to copy and enlarge the Japanese figure. He used bright colours and bold outlines, as if it were a woodcut.We can tell the woman is a courtesan by her hairstyle and the belt (obi) that she is wearing, which is tied at the front of her kimono rather than at the back. Van Gogh framed her with a pond full of water lilies, bamboo stems, cranes and frogs. This scene has a hidden meaning: grue (crane) and grenouille (frog) were French slang words for 'prostitute'."

It was done at the fishing village of Les Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer, during a trip he took from Arles in the south of France. In addition to the blue and white that he brushed onto the canvas with bold strokes, he used green and yellow for the waves. He applied these colours with a palette knife, neatly capturing the effect of the light through the waves. Van Gogh was enthusiastic about the colours of the Mediterranean Sea. He wrote that it ‘has a colour like mackerel, in other words, changing – you don’t always know if it’s green or purple – you don’t always know if it’s blue – because a second later, its changing reflection has taken on a pink or grey hue’. The bright red signature has been placed prominently in the foreground: it was intended as a ‘red note in the green’."

We look outside through the door.There is snow on the street. The sun is shining, making the scene sparkle. Across the street is the butcher shop. On the shop front, the name 'Reboul Charcutier' is visible. On the right of the shop window, sausages have been hung to dry."

Here he used shellfish. After painting them, he probably had them for supper that same day.His friend and fellow painter Paul Gauguin (1848-1903) saw this small painting. Years later, he mentioned it when writing about his memories of Van Gogh. Gauguin said that Van Gogh had sold the painting to a dealer for five francs and given away the money immediately afterwards to a poor young woman in the street."

Thin paint alternates with thick: for the light reflections on the skull he has used heavy splodges of light-coloured paint.Drying cracks are visible in many places. Look at the area immediately below the skull, for example. The paint has cracked because Van Gogh painted the skull over an earlier picture. He covered up the earlier image with a layer of zinc white – a kind of paint that dries extremely slowly. The drying out process continued after the skull had been painted over it, causing cracks to form in the top layer of paint."

He had found the same subject there. Vincent and his brother Theo collected colourful Japanese woodcuts.Here, Van Gogh painted the crab in bright shades of red against a green background. He was experimenting with what he called 'the laws of colour' described by the French painter Eugène Delacroix (1798-1863). According to this theory, colours like red and green form a pair. They are known as complementary because, when placed side by side, they both have a stronger effect. Van Gogh was a great admirer of Delacroix and had learned about his colour theory from books by Charles Blanc."

Martin allowed him to hold an exhibition there of his own work and that of his friends. Van Gogh probably painted this portrait to express his gratitude. But Martin never received it. Soon after the exhibition opened, they quarrelled. Martin claimed the pictures were spoiling the appetite of his customers. The exhibition closed early.Van Gogh painted le patron (the boss) in his working clothes. He originally used brighter colours for the portrait but changed his mind and chose muted tones instead. The red pigment has faded over time, unintentionally making the colours even softer than Van Gogh intended."

If you zoom in far enough, you can still see the black lines of the sketch between the brush strokes. Look, for instance, at the area below the foot of the tree.Research has revealed that this picture was painted on top of a previous one. To save money, Van Gogh frequently re-used his canvases in this way."

These ones have worn soles and sagging elastic. He had a preference for things ‘that bore the scars of life’. Only then were they of interest to him.In this picture, Van Gogh used oil paint heavily thinned with turpentine. You can see this from the way the line at the back of the right-hand shoe has dribbled downwards. Thinned oil paint produces a similar effect to watercolour and is known as peinture à l’essence. Van Gogh had only recently begun to experiment with this medium."

Could he produce a convincing image of it in this way? This seems to have been the question in Van Gogh’s mind when he made this study in colour.He has suggested the shiny surface of the skull by zigzagging a heavy brushload of white paint across it."

He spent two months there in the autumn of 1883. The women are at work, probably gathering dried-out peat sods. Van Gogh was fascinated with the simple country life. He had already spent more than two years trying to 'examine and draw everything that's part of a peasant's life', he wrote.While painting Women on the Peat Moor, he changed his mind about the scene a couple of times. For instance, research has shown that he first painted four figures rather than two."

He painted them frequently during the two months that he spent in Drenthe in 1883.Here, Van Gogh has worked with little precision, using broad brushes. Even so, he has provided just enough details to convey the main characteristics of the farm. On the right side of the roof are two projecting beams.

It's an explosion of colour.The background includes just about every variety of blue and green on Van Gogh’s palette. Over that, he added brushstrokes in contrasting colours: yellow, orange, red and pink. He used these same colour combinations for the apples in the foreground, but in the opposite order: the warm tones first, followed by cool green and blue accents. This created unity in the scene."

Just look at its stiff, unnatural pose.Van Gogh knew a man in Eindhoven (NL), Antoon Hermans, with a collection of more than 300 mounted exotic animals. This bat may have come from that collection.

He was training at the time under Anton Mauve, a famous artist and his cousin by marriage. In Mauve's studio, Vincent was permitted to paint this work in oils right away. For a student artist, this was a fairly rare opportunity.The painting was primarily an exercise in colour, surfaces and brushwork. It must have been a great challenge for Van Gogh to convey the different textures of the tabletop, the potatoes and the fabric. It was his first attempt and shows no sign as yet of the characteristic Van Gogh style."

In 1885, Van Gogh was living with his parents in Nuenen (NL), where he made this painting. He used a canvas on which he had previously painted a woman at work. An X-ray image brought that fact to light.The background in this still life is almost the same colour as the three bottles. Van Gogh used white paint to add light accents to the bottles – highlights. This makes them stand out from the background."

Peasant women in Brabant really did wear white headdresses in those days. These intrigued Van Gogh because of the contrast with their faces, which remained partly in shadow. 'The heads of these women here with the white caps — it’s difficult — but it’s so eternally beautiful', he wrote. At first glance, this woman's headdress looks white, but if you look more carefully you can see that Van Gogh used a variety of colours.Out of all the study heads from Nuenen, this woman is the only one whose name is known: Gordina de Groot. She is also at the table in The Potato Eaters."

The vicarage is still standing.The atmosphere in the Van Gogh home was often strained; Vincent was quick to take offence at his father's remarks.

These plastered rear facades were less attractive than the house fronts, but Van Gogh was mainly interested in the atmosphere. He had a weakness for houses like these, packed together in the poor districts of the city.Van Gogh himself lived in such an area: he rented a small room at Lange Beeldekensstraat 194. This is the rear view of that house. The painting makes a grim impression, reinforced by the thin layer of snow on the rooftops. In some places, it looks as if the snow is already melting."

He had heard that likenesses of women sold well. However, only women from the poorer segments of the population were willing to pose for an unknown painter. Van Gogh found his models among the women who worked in the port city’s cafés. They were often obliged to earn extra money as prostitutes, and this probably was the case for the woman portrayed here. Van Gogh was impressed with these ‘common’ women. He perceived an authenticity in them that he wanted to capture on canvas.Van Gogh painted this portrait in one sitting. For the shiny earring he applied a thick blob of white-and-pink paint, which broke off later. He probably depicted the same woman in another work as well, though without jewellery and with her hair loose."

Pairs like these form the basis of the colour theory of Eugène Delacroix (1798-1863), an artist Van Gogh greatly admired.Vincent studied handbooks of colour and applied what he learned in his art.

Actually, it’s more of an oil sketch than a finished painting. He has used a cheap piece of card and worked fast, with fairly broad brushes.The green of his eyes and the orange of his beard leap out at you.

The summery palette and loose brushwork betray the influence of the Impressionists. The smock, hat and background consist of large, outlined areas of colour. The face and beard are built up in more detail using different tones.Van Gogh was practising painting portraits. Because models were expensive, he bought a good mirror and used himself as his subject. He later wrote to his brother Theo: 'because if I can manage to paint the coloration of my own head, which is not without presenting some difficulty, I'll surely be able to paint the heads of the other fellows and women as well.'"
s0164V1962,Self-Portrait with Straw Hat,"https://iiif.micr.io/Rgwlg/full/900,/0/default.webp",Vincent van Gogh,40.9 cm x 32.8 cm,August-September 1887,oil on cardboard,"Wearing light summer clothes, the artist examines us with one blue and one green eye.For this self-portrait, Van Gogh used an inexpensive alternative to canvas: cardboard. He then applied a layer of priming with dashes of purple. But the pigment in that purple paint has largely faded over time. A few strokes of pink are still faintly visible in his shoulder. The original colours, carefully composed by Van Gogh, have therefore been lost. For instance, the purple background once contrasted with his yellow straw hat."
s0165V1962,Portrait of Léonie Rose Charbuy-Davy,"https://iiif.micr.io/luxFs/full/900,/0/default.webp",Vincent van Gogh,60.7 cm x 45.7 cm,March-April 1887,oil on canvas,"Much as Van Gogh would have liked to paint more portraits, he didn’t often get the chance. In the spring of 1887, he had the opportunity to paint a young Parisian woman called Léonie Rose Charbuy-Davy. She was the niece of art dealer Pierre Firmin Martin, who sometimes exhibited Van Gogh’s paintings.She is sitting by the fire, next to a baby’s cradle. The fire casts a red glow on the floor. The shape of the rest of the room is not entirely clear."
s0166V1962,Portrait of Camille Roulin,"https://iiif.micr.io/krlbf/full/900,/0/default.webp",Vincent van Gogh,40.5 cm x 32.5 cm,November-December 1888,oil on canvas,"During his time in Arles (FR), Van Gogh wanted to paint 'modern' portraits that did justice to the sitter's character. 'I seek it by way of colour,' he wrote to his sister Willemien. The blue of the cap, the green and red of the coat and the yellow of the background are all echoed in Camille's face.Camille was the youngest son of the postman Joseph Roulin, a friend of Van Gogh's. Vincent always had a hard time finding models. It was a stroke of luck that the Roulins agreed to sit for him. He painted more than twenty portraits of the family. Van Gogh made two versions of his portrait of Camille. He sent this one to Theo and gave the other one to the Roulins."
s0167V1962,Portrait of Marcelle Roulin,"https://iiif.micr.io/gZwtc/full/900,/0/default.webp",Vincent van Gogh,35.2 cm x 24.6 cm,December 1888,oil on canvas,"This plump baby was the youngest child of the postman Joseph Roulin, who sent Van Gogh's paintings from Arles to Paris. The two men became friends, and Van Gogh painted Roulin's entire family: 'the man, his wife, the baby, the young boy and the 16-year-old son, all characters and very French, although they have a Russian look,' he wrote to Theo. He painted several portraits of baby Marcelle – three by herself and two more on her mother's lap.Van Gogh sent the little portrait to Theo. Theo's wife Jo, who was pregnant at the time, wrote: 'I like to imagine that ours will be as strong, as healthy and as beautiful as that one – and that his uncle will consent to do his portrait one day!'"
s0168V1962,Pietà (after Delacroix),"https://iiif.micr.io/snjLE/full/900,/0/default.webp",Vincent van Gogh,73 cm x 60.5 cm,September 1889,oil on canvas,"Van Gogh based his Pietà on a lithograph of a painting by Eugène Delacroix. In fact, it is more a variation on the original work than a copy. From Delacroix, Van Gogh took the theme of the Virgin Mary mourning the dead Christ, as well as the composition. He added his own colour and personal signature.The painting resulted from an accident. Van Gogh wrote, 'that lithograph of Delacroix, the Pietà, with other sheets had fallen into some oil and paint and got spoiled. I was sad about it – then in the meantime I occupied myself painting it, and you'll see it one day.' The lithograph has survived, complete with stain."
s0169V1962,The Raising of Lazarus (after Rembrandt),"https://iiif.micr.io/dPaWc/full/900,/0/default.webp",Vincent van Gogh,50 cm x 65.5 cm,May 1890,oil on paper,"Van Gogh based this painting on a print by Rembrandt (1606-1669) – but only part of the print. He left out the main figure: Christ with his arm raised. Van Gogh focused on the theme of human suffering. He probably identified with Lazarus in the tomb. That would explain why he gave the figure a red beard. The two women by the grave are two acquaintances from Arles: Mrs Roulin, in the green dress, and Mrs Ginoux, in a dark dress with colourful stripes.A few of the pigments have faded considerably. This has largely done away with the original contrast between the warm colours in the background and the cold colours of Lazarus in the foreground."
s0170V1962,The Woodcutter (after Millet),"https://iiif.micr.io/uAZOk/full/900,/0/default.webp",Vincent van Gogh,44 cm x 26.2 cm,September 1889,oil on canvas,"Within a short period in September 1889, Van Gogh produced paintings based on ten prints. They included this woodcutter. The prints were a series of small wood engravings, themselves based on ten paintings by Jean-François Millet (1814-1875).Van Gogh copied the images as accurately as he could, given the small size of the engravings. He didn’t regard the resulting paintings as mere copies. He saw them as free polychrome ‘interpretations’ of monochrome prints by another artist. Just as a musician might make a new arrangement of a piece by another composer."

s0172V1962,Peasant Woman Binding Sheaves (after Millet),"https://iiif.micr.io/PWZKh/full/900,/0/default.webp",Vincent van Gogh,43.2 cm x 33.2 cm,September 1889,oil on canvas on cardboard,"This is one of twenty copies painted by Van Gogh of prints by Jean-François Millet (1814-1875). He made them during his stay in the asylum in Saint-Rémy. By studying the work of Millet and other artists he admired, he attempted to rebuild his self-confidence, which had been seriously damaged by his illness. It was also a way for him to practice figure painting even though he had no models.Van Gogh did not see these works as simple copies, although he did reproduce the scene meticulously. Instead, he regarded them as adaptations of black-and-white prints into colourful paintings. This is like a musician freely interpreting another composer's work."
