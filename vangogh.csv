s0005V1962,The Potato Eaters,"https://iiif.micr.io/yzksg/full/900,/0/default.webp",Vincent van Gogh,82 cm x 114 cm,April-May 1885,oil on canvas,"Van Gogh saw the Potato Eaters as a showpiece, for which he deliberately chose a difficult composition to prove he was on his way to becoming a good figure painter. The painting had to depict the harsh reality of country life, so he gave the peasants coarse faces and bony, working hands. He wanted to show in this way that they ‘have tilled the earth themselves with these hands they are putting in the dish ... that they have thus honestly earned their food’.  He painted the five figures in earth colours – ‘something like the colour of a really dusty potato, unpeeled of course’. The message of the painting was more important to Van Gogh than correct anatomy or technical perfection. He was very pleased with the result: yet his painting drew considerable criticism because its colours were so dark and the figures full of mistakes. Nowadays, the Potato Eaters is one of Van Gogh’s most famous works."
s0029V1962,The Sower,"https://iiif.micr.io/PoVJv/full/900,/0/default.webp",Vincent van Gogh,32.5 cm x 40.3 cm,November 1888,oil on canvas,"Van Gogh had a special interest in sowers throughout his artistic career. All in all, he made more than 30 drawings and paintings on this theme. He painted this sower in the autumn of 1888. At the time, Van Gogh was working together with Paul Gauguin (1848-1903). Gauguin believed that in his work Van Gogh should draw less on reality and more on his imagination.Here, Van Gogh used colours meant to express emotion and passion. He assigned the leading roles to the greenish-yellow of the sky and the purple of the field. The bright yellow sun looks like a halo, turning the sower into a saint."
s0022V1962,Self-Portrait as a Painter,"https://iiif.micr.io/qDCTO/full/900,/0/default.webp",Vincent van Gogh,65.1 cm x 50 cm,December 1887-February 1888,oil on canvas,"Van Gogh presented himself in this self-portrait as a painter, holding a palette and paintbrushes behind his easel. He showed that he was a modern artist by using a new painting style, with bright, almost unblended colours. The palette contains the complementary colour pairs red/green, yellow/purple and blue/orange – precisely the colours Van Gogh used for this painting. He laid these pairs down side by side to intensify one another: the blue of his smock, for instance, and the orange-red of his beard.Self-Portrait as a Painter was the last work Van Gogh produced in Paris; the city had exhausted him both mentally and physically. He told his sister Wil how he had portrayed himself: ‘wrinkles in forehead and around the mouth, stiffly wooden, a very red beard, quite unkempt and sad’."
s0049V1962,Wheatfield with a Reaper,"https://iiif.micr.io/HDzja/full/900,/0/default.webp",Vincent van Gogh,73.2 cm x 92.7 cm,September 1889,oil on canvas,"Van Gogh painted this walled field from his hospital room. For the first few months that he was there, he was not allowed to leave the grounds.The reaper labours in the heat of the sun. The wheat, painted with thick gobs of yellow, undulates around him. For Van Gogh, wheat was a symbol of the eternal cycle of nature and the transience of life. He saw the reaper as 'the image of death . . . in this sense that humanity would be the wheat being reaped.'He added, however, that this death was 'almost smiling. It's all yellow except for a line of violet hills – a pale, blond yellow. I myself find that funny, that I saw it like that through the iron bars of a cell.'"
s0106V1962,Wheatfield under Thunderclouds,"https://iiif.micr.io/fhXoU/full/900,/0/default.webp",Vincent van Gogh,50.4 cm x 101.3 cm,July 1890,oil on canvas,This painting is on display in the Musée d'Orsay exhibition Van Gogh in Auvers-sur-Oise: The Final Months until 4 February 2024.
s0515S2008,Montmartre in the Rain,"https://iiif.micr.io/AIlXy/full/900,/0/default.webp",Pierre Bonnard,69.9 cm x 95.0 cm,1897,oil on paper on panel,"When he painted this townscape, Bonnard took on a double challenge: the light was failing and it was raining. He was looking out of the window of his Montmartre studio at a view he depicted in a number of works.His decision to place an expanse of blank wall at the centre of the composition is daring. It gives the least picturesque part of the painting the most emphasis. But there is more to it: look at the perspective. Bonnard has used the difference in distance to the middle roofs and the street in an illogical way. He borrowed ideas for this kind of division of the picture plane and irregular perspective from Japanese prints."
s0383V1987,Peasant Family at the Table,"https://iiif.micr.io/WPTWb/full/900,/0/default.webp",Jozef Israëls,71 cm x 105 cm,1882,oil on canvas,No description available
s0493S1999,The Blue Dress,"https://iiif.micr.io/YMakn/full/900,/0/default.webp",Kees van Dongen,146.2 cm x 114.4 cm,in or before 1911,oil on canvas,"The Dutch painter Kees van Dongen married Augusta (Guus) Preitinger in 1901 and painted this almost life-sized painting ten years later. She gazes provocatively through her eyelashes, her hand placed nonchalantly on her hip.Although this is a portrait of Van Dongen’s wife, it is her bright blue dress that steals the show. It contrasts strongly with Guus’s pale complexion and the red background, causing it to leap out of the canvas. Van Dongen painted the shadows on his wife’s arms and neck in bright green.Working with areas of solid colour and bold contrasts is a typical feature of this artist’s work. The painting was directly inspired by Van Gogh’s bright colours and expressive brushwork."
s0027V1962,The Langlois Bridge,"https://iiif.micr.io/rzhJC/full/900,/0/default.webp",Vincent van Gogh,59.6 cm x 73.6 cm,March 1888,oil on canvas,"The sky was grey when Van Gogh painted this bridge. He worked in the open air more than once in this spot in the southern French city of Arles. Laundry was done in this canal, and linens have been laid out to bleach on the far bank. All that is missing are the washerwomen – who were included in an earlier version.Van Gogh carefully organised his composition. He chose a place for his easel where he could paint the patch of land with the road in the foreground as a large diagonal leading into the left background. He had seen diagonals of this kind used in Japanese prints. Vincent and his brother Theo had accumulated a joint collection of these prints in Paris."
s0176V1962,Almond Blossom,"https://iiif.micr.io/rAERt/full/900,/0/default.webp",Vincent van Gogh,73.3 cm x 92.4 cm,February 1890,oil on canvas,"Large blossom branches like this against a blue sky were one of Van Gogh’s favourite subjects. Almond trees flower early in the spring making them a symbol of new life. Van Gogh borrowed the subject, the bold outlines and the positioning of the tree in the picture plane from Japanese printmaking.The painting was a gift for his brother Theo and sister-in-law Jo, who had just had a baby son, Vincent Willem. In the letter announcing the new arrival, Theo wrote: ‘As we told you, we’ll name him after you, and I’m making the wish that he may be as determined and as courageous as you.’ Unsurprisingly, it was this work that remained closest to the hearts of the Van Gogh family. Vincent Willem went on to found the Van Gogh Museum."
s0149V1962,Wheatfield with Crows,"https://iiif.micr.io/QHzII/full/900,/0/default.webp",Vincent van Gogh,50.5 cm x 103 cm,July 1890,oil on canvas,This painting is on display in the Musée d'Orsay exhibition Van Gogh in Auvers-sur-Oise: The Final Months until 4 February 2024.

s0031V1962,Sunflowers,"https://iiif.micr.io/TZCqF/full/900,/0/default.webp",Vincent van Gogh,95 cm x 73 cm,January 1889,oil on canvas,"Van Gogh’s paintings of Sunflowers are among his most famous. He did them in Arles, in the south of France, in 1888 and 1889. Vincent painted a total of five large canvases with sunflowers in a vase, with three shades of yellow ‘and nothing else’. In this way, he demonstrated that it was possible to create an image with numerous variations of a single colour, without any loss of eloquence.The sunflower paintings had a special significance for Van Gogh: they communicated ‘gratitude’, he wrote. He hung the first two in the room of his friend, the painter Paul Gauguin, who came to live with him for a while in the Yellow House. Gauguin was impressed by the sunflowers, which he thought were ‘completely Vincent’. Van Gogh had already painted a new version during his friend’s stay and Gauguin later asked for one as a gift, which Vincent was reluctant to give him. He later produced two loose copies, however, one of which is now in the Van Gogh Museum."
s0047V1962,The Bedroom,"https://iiif.micr.io/ZKSPH/full/900,/0/default.webp",Vincent van Gogh,72.4 cm x 91.3 cm,October 1888,oil on canvas,This painting is on view in the exhibition Matthew Wong | Vincent van Gogh until 1 September 2024.
s0050V1962,Irises,"https://iiif.micr.io/HVTVF/full/900,/0/default.webp",Vincent van Gogh,92.7 cm x 73.9 cm,May 1890,oil on canvas,"Van Gogh painted this still life in the psychiatric hospital in Saint-Rémy. For him, the painting was mainly a study in colour. He set out to achieve a powerful colour contrast. By placing the purple flowers against a yellow background, he made the decorative forms stand out even more strongly. The irises were originally purple. But as the red pigment has faded, they have turned blue. Van Gogh made two paintings of this bouquet. In the other still life, he contrasted purple and pink with green."
s0224V1962,Self-Portrait with Portrait of Emile Bernard (Les misérables),"https://iiif.micr.io/LJtwZ/full/900,/0/default.webp",Paul Gauguin,44.5 cm x 50.3 cm,1888,oil on canvas,"Van Gogh knew that Japanese printmakers often exchanged work with one another. The idea appealed to him, so he suggested that he, Paul Gauguin and Emile Bernard should do the same: ‘It clearly proves that they liked one another and stuck together, and that there was a certain harmony among them [. . .] The more we resemble them in that respect, the better it will be for us.’ His friends both sent self-portraits, with a likeness of the other artist in the background.Gauguin painted himself in the guise of Jean Valjean, the main character of Victor Hugo’s novel Les Misérables, equating the vibrant and loving fictional outcast with the misunderstood artists of his time. He wrote: ‘By doing him with my features, you have my individual image, as well as a portrait of us all, poor victims of society, taking our revenge on it by doing good’. The cheerful floral pattern on the wall was Gauguin’s way of testifying to ‘our artistic virginity’.Van Gogh was impressed by the portrait’s melancholy character. He described the shadows in Gauguin’s face as ‘lugubriously tinged with blue’ and noted that he looked ill and tormented.’"
s0508S2003,View Seen Through a Balcony,"https://iiif.micr.io/cFuKP/full/900,/0/default.webp",Gustave Caillebotte,65.6 cm x 54.9 cm,1880,oil on canvas,"The French artist Gustave Caillebotte painted the view from his Paris balcony in 1880. The real subject of the painting, though, is the balcony itself, the cast-iron curls of which form a decorative pattern that fills the picture plane. In the distance we make out Boulevard Hausmann with a carriage, an advertising column and passers-by.Caillebotte used dark colours to emphasize the centrality of the railing. It stands out sharply against the street scene, which he painted in pastel tones. The bold composition was inspired by Japanese prints, the abrupt cropping, high vantage points and solid colours of which made them an important source for artists looking for a modern style.Van Gogh was intrigued by Caillebotte’s work. The announcement of an exhibition prompted him to write to his brother Theo: ‘there’ll be some works by Caillebotte – I’ve never seen anything of his, and wanted to ask you to write and tell me what they’re like.’"
s0032V1962,The Yellow House (The Street),"https://iiif.micr.io/NyxcG/full/900,/0/default.webp",Vincent van Gogh,72 cm x 91.5 cm,September 1888,oil on canvas,"In May 1888, Van Gogh rented four rooms in a house on Place Lamartine in Arles (southern France). The green shutters in this painting of the square show where he lived. Shortly after moving into the ‘Yellow House’, he sent Theo a description and sketch of his painting of it: ‘it’s tremendous, these yellow houses in the sunlight and then the incomparable freshness of the blue.’The work, which Van Gogh himself called ‘The Street’, records the artist’s immediate surroundings: he often ate at the restaurant on the left, and the home of his friend, the postman Joseph Roulin, lay just beyond the second railway bridge.Vincent had finally found a place at the Yellow House where he could not only paint but also have his friends come to stay. His plan was to turn the yellow corner-building into an artists’ house, where like-minded painters could live and work together."
s0195V1962,Tree Roots,"https://iiif.micr.io/giZUM/full/900,/0/default.webp",Vincent van Gogh,50.3 cm x 100.1 cm,July 1890,oil on canvas,This painting is on display in the Musée d'Orsay exhibition Van Gogh in Auvers-sur-Oise: The Final Months until 4 February 2024.
s0206V1962,Self-Portrait with Portrait of Gauguin,"https://iiif.micr.io/iXnxI/full/900,/0/default.webp",Emile Bernard,46 cm x 56 cm,1888,oil on canvas,"Bernard painted this self-portrait in the French seaside village of Pont-Aven. He was working there with Paul Gauguin (shown in the background of the picture). A Japanese woodcut print is visible at bottom right.Van Gogh had asked his two friends to make portraits of each other. But Bernard didn’t dare: he was only 20 and intimidated by Gauguin, who was twice his age. So each of them sent a self-portrait featuring a sketch of the other. Beside his signature, Bernard wrote a dedication to his friend (‘copain’) Van Gogh. The added ‘g’ at the end of ‘copain’ was a joke about the local accent in Provence, where Van Gogh was living."
s0424M1991,Haymaking,"https://iiif.micr.io/sbzXD/full/900,/0/default.webp",Léon-Augustin Lhermitte,215.9 cm x 265.8 cm,1887,oil on canvas,"This enormous painting by the French artist Léon Lhermitte shows a family of peasants resting during haymaking. The work probably has a symbolic element too, evoking youth, maturity and old age. The old man at the front holds a scythe, a traditional symbol of approaching death. This kind of symbolism and the emphasis on the romantic, idyllic side of peasant life made works of this type extremely popular in the late nineteenth century. The Haymakers won the Grand Prix at the 1889 World Exhibition in Paris.Lhermitte became a famous painter of rural life. According to Vincent van Gogh, the French artist’s secret was ‘that he knows the figure in general – namely the sturdy, severe workman’s figure – through and through, and takes his subjects from the heart of the people.’Van Gogh too hoped to establish himself as a painter of peasant life, and so Lhermitte’s work was an important source of inspiration to him. He regularly asked his brother Theo to send him reproductions of Lhermitte’s paintings."
s0019V1962,Garden with Courting Couples: Square Saint-Pierre,"https://iiif.micr.io/wTQHw/full/900,/0/default.webp",Vincent van Gogh,75.0 cm x 113.0 cm,May 1887,oil on canvas,"Van Gogh called this sunny park scene 'the painting of the garden with lovers'. Couples in love are strolling under the young chestnut trees and sitting along the winding paths.He used a free variation on the technique of the Pointillists. They built up their compositions from dots of paint. Van Gogh instead applied small brushstrokes of varying length in different directions. This helped him to create the effect of a radiant spring day, which fit the sense of intimacy and togetherness he wished to express. He too longed for a wife and a family, but he had 'the most impossible love affairs'. He eventually resigned himself to the situation; he was devoted to his art."
s0225V1962,Vincent van Gogh Painting Sunflowers,"https://iiif.micr.io/iWYqT/full/900,/0/default.webp",Paul Gauguin,73 cm x 91 cm,1888,oil on canvas,"Was Van Gogh really painting a vase of sunflowers when his friend Gauguin produced this portrait of him? No, he can’t have been: it was December and far too late in the year for sunflowers. But it’s quite probable that Van Gogh painted a copy of one of his own sunflower pictures around this time. The landscape in the background is also fictional: unlike Van Gogh, Gauguin liked to work from his imagination. They often argued about this. This painting refers to their disagreement. Later, Van Gogh wrote about this portrait: ‘My face has lit up a lot since, but it was indeed me, extremely tired and charged with electricity as I was then.’"
d0364V1968,Pollard Birches,"https://iiif.micr.io/wsTyi/full/900,/0/default.webp",Vincent van Gogh,39.5 cm x 54.2 cm,March 1884,pencil,"Van Gogh loved pollard trees with their gnarled trunks. They feature prominently in many of his paintings and drawings, including this one. In a letter to his brother Theo, he compared a row of pollard trees to a 'procession of orphan men'. What he meant was that nature had a soul of its own.This work is part of a series of seven pen and ink drawings of Brabant landscapes from 1884. The compositions are compelling. The way he drew it, with a great deal of hatching, shows his individual style. The drawings form a high point of Van Gogh's work in the Netherlands."
d0171V1962,Peasant Woman Digging,"https://iiif.micr.io/CDSdE/full/900,/0/default.webp",Vincent van Gogh,55.7 cm x 41.0 cm,July-September 1885,chalk on paper,"Van Gogh struggled for a long time to represent figures convincingly: they tended to look too flat. He realised in 1885 that he needed to build them up from large round forms rather than contours. This burly peasant woman is a successful example. The proportions may not be accurate, but this was deliberate: Van Gogh wanted to make the drawing more expressive.In a letter to his brother Theo, Vincent described his drawings of farm workers as 'the start of a whole series about all kinds of work in the fields'. He hoped that scenes of this kind would establish his reputation as an artist of peasant life."
d0344V1962,The Rock of Montmajour with Pine Trees,"https://iiif.micr.io/jThsE/full/900,/0/default.webp",Vincent van Gogh,49.1 cm x 61.0 cm,July 1888,pencil,"Van Gogh drew this jagged rock with pine trees using a reed pen – a drawing tool that lent itself to supple and vigorous lines. He developed his own drawing style with it, consisting of stipples and stripes in all sizes, thicknesses and directions.Van Gogh made this drawing on the hill of Montmajour, near Arles. His fascination with the landscape around the hill inspired a series of pen drawings, which form a high point in his oeuvre. He accepted the fierce mistral wind and the many mosquitoes as the price he had to pay. 'If a view makes one forget those little vexations, there must be something in it,' he wrote to his brother Theo."
d0222V1962,Garden of the Hospital,"https://iiif.micr.io/MnMlg/full/900,/0/default.webp",Vincent van Gogh,46.6 cm x 59.9 cm,May 1889,pencil,"For months, Van Gogh looked out over this courtyard of the hospital in Arles. That was in the spring of 1889. He drew the lush garden while staying there for treatment of his mental condition.Van Gogh drew with a reed pen, filling almost the entire page. It takes a while before you notice that a few figures are visible. There are people in the upper left, on the upstairs gallery. And on the far side of the garden, there are two nuns. As if it were a puzzle, he placed his signature on a watering can on the lower right, in front of the tall tree."
s0530N2012,Tulip Fields near The Hague,"https://iiif.micr.io/WONpp/full/900,/0/default.webp",Claude Monet,66 cm x 81.5 cm,1886,oil on canvas,"Claude Monet was enormously impressed by the brightly coloured bulb fields of Holland. In the early spring of 1886, he wrote to a friend that the sight was ‘impossible to convey with our poor colours’. Monet had been to the Netherlands before, but was painting the sea of flowers for the first time.Back in Paris, he sold the painting via art dealers Boussod, Valadon & Cie, where Theo van Gogh worked. It’s quite possible that his brother Vincent saw it there. Vincent gradually came to admire Monet’s swift brushstrokes and bright colours."
d0378V1962,Worn Out,"https://iiif.micr.io/oWRVN/full/900,/0/default.webp",Vincent van Gogh,50.4 cm x 31.6 cm,November 1882,pencil on paper,"'What a fine sight an old working man makes, in his patched bombazine suit with his bald head,' Van Gogh wrote about this drawing. The artist had a penchant for working-class figures, marked by life, and the title Worn Out emphasizes the dramatic element of his chosen theme.This tired, bent old man lived at the Dutch Reformed Almshouse for Men and Women in The Hague. Residents of the home posed for Van Gogh in old, worn-out clothing in return for a small payment.Van Gogh made dozens of large figure drawings in The Hague, in which he practised representing human proportions, poses and facial expressions."
d0420V1962,Gate in the Paris Ramparts,"https://iiif.micr.io/TznmE/full/900,/0/default.webp",Vincent van Gogh,24.1 cm x 31.6 cm,June-September 1887,pencil,"In the summer of 1887, Van Gogh made four watercolour drawings of the city walls around Paris. This is most likely the Porte de Clichy – one of 25 gates leading into the French capital.The lively cityscape is filled with little figures and details like the horse-drawn tram. Van Gogh drew inspiration for this drawing from the crowded street scenes in Japanese prints. The bright colours of those prints also stimulated his creativity.This cityscape is one of the few drawings he made in Paris. He mostly worked in oil paint on canvas during his time there and developed a brighter, more modern colour palette. Colour and brightness also play a central role in this watercolour drawing."

The window looks out over the walled garden. Pots and bottles stand on the windowsill. Several of Van Gogh's own paintings hang on either side of the window.Van Gogh began by setting out his design in black chalk. Then he developed the drawing further using thinned oil paint and a little watercolour. Between the bars and the blue of the sky he left the paper visible, which adds depth to the scene."

At first he was not allowed to leave the walled grounds of the institution. Fortunately, the overgrown garden offered him plenty of inspiration. This drawing is a realistic representation of that garden."

The paint was applied in tiny dots and dashes of contrasting colour. It wasn’t easy: Pissarro wrote to his son that he had wrestled with this painting for days to achieve precisely what he had in mind.Van Gogh greatly admired Pissarro’s colour effects and followed his example. He may well have known this particular painting. His brother Theo, who was an art dealer, sold it in 1887."

They were poverty-stricken and had to work very hard to earn a living. He made sixteen large drawings of them, including this one in watercolour and ink.The loom fills almost the entire picture. Van Gogh devoted considerable attention to representing the machine accurately. It was hard, 'because in the small rooms one can't get far enough away to draw the loom', he wrote.Vincent was confident about the qualities of his weaver drawings. He hoped to be able to sell them. That probably explains why he signed this drawing."

He completed only a few large, finished drawings, including this one of a vineyard in Auvers. We find the same wavy lines in his late paintings.Van Gogh began with a pencil drawing. Then he added oil paint and watercolour in many different shades of blue. He painted some of the roofs red, but these have since faded to brown. Because he left large areas of the paper blank, the colour white plays a large role in the scene."

The picture shows Christ sitting at table and breaking bread. Facing him is Denis himself. He is the disciple who has just realised the identity of his extraordinary table companion. Denis’ wife Marthe is entering the room carrying a dish.Denis presents the Bible story in a modern setting: the inn in his own home town. Notice the contemporary rug on the floor , for example. But the composition, with its glimpses of the outside world, is inspired by early Italian frescoes. Denis also made a print based on this painting."

In Drenthe, peat was stacked in the form of a house with a sloping roof. Van Gogh gave the stack of peat a central place in his composition and showed its reflection in the ditch.He wrote to his brother Theo that at dusk the fields of Drenthe were transformed into a 'sublime' place, 'when that vast, sun-scorched earth stands out dark against the delicate lilac tints of the evening sky, and the very last fine dark blue line on the horizon separates earth from sky'."

The tower had remained standing when the church collapsed a century earlier, but at the time of this painting it was being demolished. The steeple is already gone.In a letter to his brother Theo, Vincent explained what he wanted this painting to express. He saw the dilapidated church tower as a symbol of the ephemeral nature of religion. In his eyes, it formed a stark contrast with the country graveyard next to it. There, farmers lay buried in the same soil they once had tilled. This showed that their lives were rooted in the eternal truths of death and rebirth."
s0008V1962,Still Life with Bible,"https://iiif.micr.io/dGWrA/full/900,/0/default.webp",Vincent van Gogh,65.7 cm x 78.5 cm,October 1885,oil on canvas,"This hefty Bible had belonged to Van Gogh's father, a Protestant minister. Van Gogh painted it just after his father's death. He placed his own copy of Émile Zola's La joie de vivre next to it. That book was a kind of 'bible' for modern life. The books symbolize the different worldviews of Van Gogh and his father.Vincent described this work to Theo as 'a still life of an open, hence an off-white Bible, bound in leather, against a black background with a yellow-brown foreground, with an additional note of lemon yellow.' He wanted to show that the colour black could be effective. The brothers had previously discussed this question at length.Theo thought Vincent's canvases were too dark and gloomy. He encouraged his brother to use lighter, brighter tones, as the Impressionists did."
s0006V1962,Head of a Woman,"https://iiif.micr.io/OWGiO/full/900,/0/default.webp",Vincent van Gogh,43.2 cm x 30.0 cm x 2.2 cm,April 1885,oil on canvas,"This woman is Gordina de Groot, who posed with her family for The Potato Eaters. To prepare for that painting, Van Gogh made over 40 studies of farmworkers' heads, including this one. He hoped this would make him a better figure painter.Van Gogh wanted to portray peasants as people of a special kind, who had been working the land for centuries. 'They remind one of the earth, sometimes appear to have been modelled out of it,' Vincent wrote to his brother Theo.This work was a study in colour. Van Gogh concentrated on the complementary colours red and green."
s0016V1962,Self-Portrait with Grey Felt Hat,"https://iiif.micr.io/pMtwg/full/900,/0/default.webp",Vincent van Gogh,44.5 cm x 37.2 cm,September-October 1887,oil on cotton,"Van Gogh painted this self-portrait in the winter of 1887–88, when he had been in Paris for almost two years. It is clear from the work that he had studied the technique of the Pointillists and applied it in his own, original way. He placed the short stripes of paint in different directions. Where they follow the outline of his head, they form a kind of halo.The painting is also one of Van Gogh’s boldest colour experiments in Paris. He placed complementary colours alongside one another using long brushstrokes: blue and orange in the background, and red and green in the beard and eyes. The colours intensify one another. The red pigment has faded, so the purple strokes are now blue, which means the contrast with the yellow is less powerful."
s0011V1962,Shoes,"https://iiif.micr.io/EJgic/full/900,/0/default.webp",Vincent van Gogh,38.1 cm x 45.3 cm,September-November 1886,oil on canvas,Worn-out shoes were an unusual choice of subject for a painting. An acquaintance of Van Gogh's in Paris described how he bought old work shoes at a flea market. Then he walked through the mud in them until they were filthy. Only then did he feel they were interesting enough to paint. Van Gogh made a number of still lifes of this subject.He painted Shoes over another picture: a view from his brother Theo's apartment. Van Gogh used the same canvas more than once on other occasions too. It was a way of saving money.
s0020V1962,Carafe and Dish with Citrus Fruit,"https://iiif.micr.io/TQzrj/full/900,/0/default.webp",Vincent van Gogh,46.3 cm x 38.4 cm,February-March 1887,oil on canvas,"Painting a glass object is difficult. Van Gogh made the challenge even greater, choosing an elaborate carafe and decorative wallpaper. This made it necessary for him to render the colourful reflections in the glass.The tabletop underneath the dish of lemons is tilted upward. This is not a mistake, but a choice. Van Gogh was trying out a perspective technique he had learned from Japanese woodcuts. Their strong diagonals fascinated him. Vincent signed and dated this still life. He did that only when he was satisfied with his work."
s0015V1962,Montmartre: Windmills and Allotments,"https://iiif.micr.io/InWiA/full/900,/0/default.webp",Vincent van Gogh,45.2 cm x 81.4 cm,March-April 1887,oil on canvas,"In Paris, Van Gogh frequently painted the picturesque windmills on the hill of Montmartre. In his day, Montmartre was still a partly rural area with allotment gardens and farms.Van Gogh hoped that this subject would sell well. He took the fresh, pure colours – the white of the fields and bright blue of the sheds – from contemporary French art. To render sunlight in this landscape, Van Gogh used highly diluted oil paint. This resulted in a translucent, matt effect. He chose a canvas with an unusual, elongated shape. That creates an effect like that of a wide-angle lens. The paths and gardens fan out, drawing our eyes toward the horizon."

He chose a subject close to home, the hill of Montmartre in Paris, and painted the view from the hill to the northwest. In the distance, the hills of Meudon are visible. There are allotment gardens in the foreground.Van Gogh used a variety of brushwork here over a light ground, from light strokes to quick dashes and specks of paint. The influence of the Impressionists is clear from the bright colours and loose painting technique."

He showed with this still life that he was a genuine colourist, working almost exclusively with shades of yellow, as well as a little green, blue, red and pink. He used threads of wool to try out colour combinations before beginning to paint.Van Gogh also painted the frame of this work. It is the only original frame that has survived. He dedicated the painting to Theo, who had frequently encouraged him to add more colour to his work."

They then resemble silver coins, and in Dutch this plant is called the judaspenning, 'coin of Judas'. This is a reference to the apostle Judas, who betrayed Christ for 30 pieces of silver. He is said to have thrown the coins to the ground when he hanged himself. Where they landed, the honesty plant later grew. This is one of the first still lifes painted by Van Gogh."

He created depth in the composition by making the roofs and chimneys in the foreground seem close by. Further away, the outlines of monumental buildings are visible in the city centre. Panthéon, Louvre, Notre Dame; all of them have been identified.Van Gogh made the buildings fairly large and detailed in proportion to the rest of the landscape. He probably used a telescope. There are still telescopic viewers on the hill so that tourists can take in the view."

The unpaved street has stone gutters, represented by blue stripes. The mill on wheels in the centre was probably a movable billboard. There were several real mills on the hill of Montmartre in Paris, and one is visible in the background (the Moulin à Poivre). In Van Gogh's day, these mills were no longer in operation but served as an entertainment venue and tourist attraction. The entrances were decorated with flags."

The books with yellow covers are not immediately identifiable to 21st-century viewers. But Van Gogh's contemporaries recognised them as modern French paperbacks.Van Gogh was an avid reader and an admirer of novelists such as the Goncourt brothers and Emile Zola. They offered a realistic, unvarnished perspective on modern life.The open book in the foreground invites the viewer to come and read."

Would he paint the scene by daylight or lamplight? He couldn’t decide, so he was experimenting with all sorts of interior light effects.In this picture, he was attempting to paint a figure against the light. It was hard to do, he wrote to his brother Theo, ‘it’s a difficult effect’. With the almost black head of the woman and using a lot of white in the window, he succeeded in achieving a strong contrast. He concentrated the light from the window mainly on the woman’s hands."

In 1885, he made them the subject of five still lifes in a row. He wrote to his brother Theo that he thought these would appeal to nature lovers, 'because of the colours of the moss, dry leaves and grasses, clay &c.'.Earlier that summer, Vincent had told Theo how he got the nests. He had gone out with a peasant boy to look for them. They found six, 'from which the young had already flown, so that one could take them without too many pangs of conscience.'"

Van Gogh liked bonnets like this, which made a fine contrast with dark clothing and backgrounds. Using rough brushstrokes, Van Gogh suggested the shadows in her face.In Antwerp (BE), Van Gogh wanted to master portrait painting. He heard from local art dealers that women's heads sold better than men's. From that time on, he focused on female models."

That was already true in Van Gogh's day. But the hill of Montmartre then had buildings only on one side. Here, Van Gogh painted the other side. You can see quarries and a view of the mills, which had already been absorbed into the built-up part of the district. In the foreground is a pile of wood; behind it are blocks of stone.Van Gogh was not the only artist to paint this picturesque place. He hoped that if he depicted a familiar scene, his painting would sell well. Unfortunately, it did not work out that way."

She had a brief relationship with Van Gogh. There is a glass of beer on the table, and Agostina holds a lit cigarette. The saucers under the glass on the table betray the fact that she is on her second beer. Drinking and smoking in a café was not appropriate for respectable ladies. That way of life was associated with artistic types and prostitutes.Van Gogh had organized an exhibition at the café to sell his collection of Japanese prints. Japanese prints can be seen in the background of this portrait. He may have painted Agostina during the exhibition."
